# 🚀 My Journey Through Kaggle Playground Series

This repository is a living record of my journey through the **2026 Kaggle Playground Series - SEASON 6**. 

In this world, data isn't just numbers on a spreadsheet—it’s a puzzle waiting to be solved. My mission is to transform raw, synthetic signals into high-accuracy predictions, mastering the art of Machine Learning one episode at a time.

## My Mission
I don't just "run code." I build pipelines. I don't just "predict." I uncover the hidden "artifacts" within synthetic datasets. Using a powerhouse of tools—including **Python**, **VS Code**, and the **Kaggle Cloud**—I am sharpening my skills in:
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the "why" behind the data.
* **Feature Engineering:** Crafting new variables to give my models a competitive edge.
* **Advanced Modeling:** Orchestrating ensembles of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

## My current Toolkit
To achieve, I rely on these stack:
* **Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (My primary forge for clean, modular code).
* **Environment:** [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code) (Utilized for high-performance GPU/TPU acceleration when the quest demands it).
* **Core Libraries:** `Pandas` & `NumPy` for data manipulation, `Scikit-Learn` for the foundational ML logic, and `Matplotlib`/`Seaborn` for storytelling through visuals.
* **The Intelligence:** **Gemini AI** acts as my senior consultant, helping me debug complex logic and refine my strategies.
